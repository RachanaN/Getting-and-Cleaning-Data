# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Project Work
The project is to download the files from  a zip folder.
The folder contains files downloaded from the link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
There are two folders - train and test. 
We will then read the data into R and merge the data sets.
We will merge the traing data sets first, then the test data sets, subject data sets
we will then merge all the data
extract all the activity labels and feature names
We are then doing simple cleaning process of the data to get cleaned data
The cleaned data is now written into a text file called Samsung_Data.txt
